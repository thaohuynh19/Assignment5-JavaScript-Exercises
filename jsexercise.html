/* Part 1 */

//var z; alert(type z); //The result is "undefined". This is because the variable z is not assgined to anything 
//alert(!! false); //The result is "false". This is because the operator "!" returns false into true statements and vice versa. However, since there is two "!!" this means that it is false.
//alert(7%2); //The result is "1". This is because the "%" is a division remainder that codes the remainder of the 7/2 to give us a 1.
//var name="Jim"; alert(name+" Smith"); //The result is "Jim Smith". This is because the variable has a value of name "Jim" and a string along of "Smith" giving us the name Jim Smith
//var myNum="5"; alert(myNum+2); //The result if "52". This is because it the value has a number of "5" that is string along with "2" giving us a "52".

/* Part 2 */

//The difference between Java and Javascript is that Java is more programming languaged where it uses objects to perform actions while Javascript is more scripting language.
// The difference between the + and ++ operators in Javascript is that single plus sign is a math symbol that is used for adding numbers while the double plus sign is an increment operator that is used to add additional values
//The difference between using window.alert(), console.log() and document.write() is that window.alert() will display a popup window on your browser. document.write() on the otherhand is used for addition content on the webpage and lastly console.log() shows all the information of the webpage that is used for debugging
//The difference between =,==, and === operators is that one is used to give value to a variable. Whiile the double is used to to determine whether they're equal or not but the triple also has the same functions as the double. However, triple can only be used when they're the exact values and same data type.
//The difference between the two types of loops: while and do while is that they both loop through the code block if the condition is true however, do while loops despite if the condition is false.


/* Part 3*/

var name=prompt("Enter your first name");
var capName=name.ToUpperCase();
var i=1;
do { 
    document.write("Welcome"+capName+"!"+"<br/>");
    i++; 
}
    while(i<3)
